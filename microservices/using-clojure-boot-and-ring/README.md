# Microservice using Clojure boot and ring

Using clojure boot to setup a ring server for a microservice.

## Steps I took to create this example

- Install boot with `brew install boot`
- Create `build.boot` and `src/sample.clj` from [ring example](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/wiki/Setup-for-development)
- Run `boot dev`
- Visit http://localhost:3000
