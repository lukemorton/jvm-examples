# Microservice using Maven and Spring Boot from CLI

Using Maven and Spring Boot from CLI to create a server for a microservice.

## Steps I took to create this example

- Install sbt with `brew install sbt`
- Install sample app with `sbt new scalatra/scalatra.g8`
- Fill in template values as promoted by previous command (I just hit ENTER for all of them)
- Jump into your new sample app
- Run the sbt REPL with `sbt`
- Within the REPL, run `jetty:start`
- Visit http://localhost:8080/
