# JVM Examples

Playing around with the JVM.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

You'll need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed ahead of running these examples. You might also need Java, but I think the install steps for each guide must do that for you.

You can assume I was using [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) unless the guide specifically mentions an alternative.

I'm assuming you're using a Mac in these guides, sorry Linux and Windows folk!

## Microservices

- Clojure: [Using Clojure Boot and Ring](microservices/using-clojure-boot-and-ring)
- Java in IntelliJ: [Using IntelliJ, Maven and Spring Boot](microservices/using-intellij-maven-and-spring-boot)
- Java from CLI: [Using Maven and Spring Boot from CLI](microservices/using-maven-and-spring-boot)
